                    Though.. how did this wonderful website come to be
                    what it is today?
                    Well, although we're still in early development..
                    the website was originally an idea I've had before
                    and I kinda just kept in in mind for a while and then..
                    I joined Twitter lol. At that point, it was basically my
                    only way of communication with other users and finding new
                    friends. But over time, Twitter started to become worse
                    and rebranded to a literal letter.. so I decided that I needed
                    to take matters into my own hands since I was tired of joining
                    new apps that would eventually seem to fail. I then decided "
                    why make the website for just myself when I could make it for
                    others too?", so I put off my original project to develop a new
                    index.html file.

                <code class="WITCParagraph">
                    Hello, I am Zack (not my actual name, I swear), I am the creator
                    of SnowwNet and I'd love to welcome you to my website, in case
                    you're wondering, SnowwNet is created by a 17 year old who loves
                    to make awesome creations just like the one you're in right now.
                    I actually make so much more and you can find the links to that stuff
                    around my website, for example, my personal website is listed above!!
                    Feel completely free to check it out and explore my creations,
                    after all, they're not just for me! Some of my creations pertain to
                    the webiste and are made directly for it as a new upcoming feature that
                    will possibly be later implemented into the website. Meanwhile some
                    other creations of mine have nothing to do with SnowwNet itself but are
                    always still cool nonetheless!

                    <code class="StrangeRandomFiles">About Our Random Files:</code>
                <code class="ATRFYMCAParagraph">
                    If you like to explore, maybe a little too much.. then you've probably
                    found some strange random files that you may come across in the site from
                    time to time. These files are nothing dangerous, they're just certain
                    files from my creations that I've explained before but the only difference
                    is that they were probably released with the server on purpose but these
                    files aren't just useless, you can still click the links if you'd like but
                    I do warn you to not go around anymore because these "Strange Files" are
                    actually the update files I was talking about, I choose to release them early
                    sometimes because they do still tend to have "some" sort of working property
                    to them, Project Color is a huge example of this situation if you ever do
                    encounter these files.
